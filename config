#
# Basics:
#

    # Kill focused window


    # Start your launcher

    # Drag floating windows by holding down $mod and left mouse button.
    # Resize them with right mouse button + $mod.
    # Despite the name, also works for non-floating windows.
    # Change normal to inverse to use left mouse button for resizing and right
    # mouse button for dragging.

    # Reload the configuration file

    # Exit sway (logs you out of your Wayland session)
#
# Moving around:
#
    # Move your focus around
    # Or use $mod+[up|down|left|right]

    # Move the focused window with the same, but add Shift
    # Ditto, with arrow keys
#
# Workspaces:
#
    # Switch to workspace
    # Move focused container to workspace
    # Note: workspaces can have any name you want, not just numbers.
    # We just use 1-10 as the default.
#
# Layout stuff:
#
    # You can "split" the current object of your focus with
    # $mod+b or $mod+v, for horizontal and vertical splits
    # respectively.

    # Switch the current container between different layout styles

    # Make the current focus fullscreen

    # Toggle the current focus between tiling and floating mode

    # Swap focus between the tiling area and the floating area

    # Move focus to the parent container
#
# Scratchpad:
#
    # Sway has a "scratchpad", which is a bag of holding for windows.
    # You can send windows there and get them back later.

    # Move the currently focused window to the scratchpad

    # Show the next scratchpad window or hide the focused scratchpad window.
    # If there are multiple scratchpad windows, this command cycles through them.
#
# Resizing containers:
#
mode "resize" {
    # left will shrink the containers width
    # right will grow the containers width
    # up will shrink the containers height
    # down will grow the containers height

    # Ditto, with arrow keys

    # Return to default mode
}
#
# Utilities:
#
    # Special keys to adjust volume via PulseAudio
    # Special keys to adjust brightness via brightnessctl
    # Special key to take a screenshot with grim

input "type:touchpad" {
    tap enabled
    natural_scroll enabled
}

input "type:keyboard" {
    xkb_options "caps:ctrl_modifier"
}
